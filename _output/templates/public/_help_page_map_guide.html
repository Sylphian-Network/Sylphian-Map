            <p>
                Map markers are locations on the <a href="{{ link('map') }}">community map</a>.
                Each marker includes some <b>required details</b> and several <b>optional extras</b> to better describe the place or event.
            </p>

            <h4>Required fields</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Title</b> – The name of the place or event.</li>
                <li><b>Type</b> – Specify what kind of marker it is (e.g. event, business, member).</li>
                <li><b>Latitude & Longitude</b> – The coordinates where the marker will appear.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Optional fields</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Content</b> – A description, notes, or further details about the marker.</li>
                <li><b>Address</b> – Street address or location reference.</li>
                <li><b>Icon / Variant / Colour</b> – Customise how the marker appears on the map.</li>
                <li><b>Marker colour</b> – Highlight different categories with distinct colours.</li>
                <li><b>Create a thread</b> – Automatically start a discussion linked to this marker.</li>
                <li><b>Lock thread replies</b> – Prevent replies if you’d like the thread to be read-only.</li>
                <li><b>Start / End date</b> – Show when an event begins and finishes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>
                Adding a marker for <i>“Community Meet-up”</i> might look like this:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Title: Community Meet-up</li>
                <li>Type: Event</li>
                <li>Latitude/Longitude: 51.5072, -0.1276</li>
                <li>Content: Join us for coffee and a chat!</li>
                <li>Start Date: 5 October 2025, 6:00pm</li>
                <li>End Date: 5 October 2025, 7:00pm</li>

        <div class="block-body block-row">
            <p>
                Suggesting a marker is simple: go to the <a href="{{ link('map') }}">community map</a> and click
                the <b>Suggest marker</b> button. A form will appear where you can enter the details of the place or event
                you’d like to add.
            </p>

            <p>
                After adding all the details, click <b>Save</b> to submit your marker for review.
                A moderator (or another approved user) will review your submission before it appears on the map.

            <p>
                Event markers behave a little differently from other types of markers.
                They can animate on the map to make it easier to spot upcoming or ongoing events:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Active events</b> – Events currently in progress will <i>pulse</i> on the map,
                    drawing attention so you can find them at a glance.</li>
                <li><b>Upcoming events</b> – Events starting within the next 7 days will <i>bounce</i>
                    gently to show they’re about to happen.</li>
                <li><b>Past events</b> – When an event has ended, its marker will disappear from the map
                    (or be hidden automatically during clean-up).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This makes it easy to see not only where events are happening,
                but also which ones you can still attend soon.

            <p>
                The events widget gives you a quick way to see what’s happening in the community
                without needing to browse the whole map. It lists the most recent event markers that
                are currently active or coming up soon.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Active events</b> – If an event is in progress right now, it will appear at the top of the widget.</li>
                <li><b>Upcoming events</b> – Events that are starting soon will also be shown, ordered by start date.</li>
                <li><b>Quick links</b> – Each event entry includes a link to the full discussion thread if one was created.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This makes the widget a handy “at a glance” view of what’s happening in the community.
