Time-based markers allow you to create map points that automatically appear and disappear based on specified dates. Perfect for events, temporary locations, and scheduled activities. Markers with start and end dates will only be visible on the map during that timeframe, while those without dates remain permanently visible. Use this feature to keep your map current without manual updates.
